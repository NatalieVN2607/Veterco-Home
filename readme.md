# Veterco Home

## Project Overview
Veterco is a premium animal health company offering innovative solutions for veterinary professionals and pet owners alike. This mockup website aims to replicate the modern, product-centric design style of Codeage.com while showcasing Veterco's brand.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Core technologies for the static prototype.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first framework for rapid styling (planned integration).
- **Next.js** – Framework intended for future dynamic pages and routing.
- **External Resources** – Fonts from Google (Inter, Cormorant Garamond) and media assets from Unsplash and Coverr.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Veterco-Home
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (optional – for future Node.js integration)
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run a local development server**
   We recommend using [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server):
   ```bash
   npx live-server public
   ```
   This requires Node.js and npm to be installed.
