# Veterco Home

This project is a simple static prototype of the Veterco homepage inspired by Codeage.
It demonstrates a hero video header, product modules and an expandable sidebar
navigation.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (none are required for the static site but you may
   install dev tools):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run a local server**. Any static server or the VS Code Live Server plugin
   will work. For example:

   ```bash
   npx serve public
   ```

3. **Open `public/index.html`** in your browser to view the site.

## Project Goals

- Provide a responsive hero section with video background
- Showcase product modules with scroll animations
- Offer a fixed sidebar menu that collapses on mobile
- Include a multi-column footer for quick navigation

## Testing

This project has no automated tests. Running `npm test` will simply print a
placeholder message.
